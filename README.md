# Consulting-Project

This repository comprises two categories: selected statistical consulting reports and research deliverables. Each report addresses a biomedical or clinical question using sound statistical methodology and clear communication for non-technical audiences. The consulting reports often include coding snippets and practical guides for physicians. The research section features undergraduate projects - where I independently led the design, analysis, and interpretation—and my recently completed Master’s project (3-credit), which is undergoing final refinements based on supervisor feedback prior to publication.

# 📁 Project Folder Overview

This `Project` folder contains research deliverables from both my undergraduate and master’s studies.  
Each project demonstrates full responsibility over study design, statistical analysis, interpretation, and reporting.

The Master's project was recently completed and is currently undergoing final edits based on supervisor feedback.  
Several projects also include reproducible code and Quarto files to ensure transparency.
