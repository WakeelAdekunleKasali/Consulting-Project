# Consulting-Project

This repository comprises two categories: selected statistical consulting reports and research deliverables. Each report addresses a biomedical or clinical question using sound statistical methodology and clear communication for non-technical audiences. The consulting reports often include coding snippets and practical guides for physicians. The research section features undergraduate projects‚Äîwhere I independently led the design, analysis, and interpretation‚Äîand my recently completed Master‚Äôs project (3-credit), which is undergoing final refinements based on supervisor feedback prior to publication.
